// This class implements the `Hello` interface and provides the actual implementation of the `sayHello` method.
// It extends `UnicastRemoteObject` to allow remote method invocation.
// The constructor throws a `RemoteException`, which is required for RMI objects.
// The `sayHello` method returns a simple greeting string, which can be invoked by RMI clients.
// The `UnicastRemoteObject` class is used to export the remote object so that it can receive remote calls.
// The `RemoteException` is thrown to indicate that a remote method call has failed.
// This implementation is part of a complete RMI application, which includes the server and client code to interact with this remote object.
// The server code binds this implementation to the RMI registry, and the client code looks it up to call the `sayHello` method.
// The `HelloImpl` class is the server-side implementation of the `Hello` interface, which defines the remote method `sayHello`.
// The `sayHello` method can be called by clients to receive a greeting message from the server.
// The `HelloImpl` class is essential for the RMI application, as it provides the functionality that clients will invoke remotely.
// The `HelloImpl` class is typically compiled and run on the server side, while the client code runs on a different machine or process to invoke the remote method.
// The `HelloImpl` class is a key part of the RMI architecture, allowing remote method invocations to be handled by the server.
// The `HelloImpl` class is registered with the RMI registry, allowing clients to look it up and invoke its methods remotely.
// The `HelloImpl` class is a remote object that can be accessed by clients over the network using RMI.
// The `HelloImpl` class is a concrete implementation of the `Hello` interface, which defines the remote method `sayHello`.
// The `HelloImpl` class is used to create a remote object that can be accessed by RMI clients.
// The `HelloImpl` class is part of the RMI server application, which allows clients to invoke methods on this remote object.
// The `HelloImpl` class is essential for the RMI server, as it provides the implementation of the remote methods that clients will call.
// The `HelloImpl` class is typically compiled and run on the server side, while the client code runs on a different machine or process to invoke the remote method.
